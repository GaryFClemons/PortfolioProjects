Public repository containing projects that showcase my skills as an analyst

The SQL files attached show how i used CASE, CAST, temporary tables, JOIN's, subqueries, Common Table Expressions, 
window functions, and stored procedures with parameters to query the Microsoft AdventureWorks Sample Database.
Microsofts AdventureWorks Sample data base can be found here: https://github.com/microsoft/sql-server-samples/tree/master/samples/databases/adventure-works

i executed the install script from the Repository listed above on SQL Server Management Studio to restore the database
to my machine.
