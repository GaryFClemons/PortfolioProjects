# PortfolioProjects
Public repository containing projects that showcase my skills as an analyst

# SQL 
In the SQL folder there are stored procedures that I wrote to demonstrate using CASE, CAST, Temporary Tables, JOIN's,  Aggregate Functions, Subqueries, Common Table Expressions, Window Functions, and Parameters to query the Microsoft AdventureWorks Sample Database. Microsoft's AdventureWorks Sample database can be found here: https://github.com/microsoft/sql-server-samples/tree/master/samples/databases/adventure-works/oltp-install-script
I executed the install script from the Repository listed above on SQL Server Management Studio to restore the sample database
to my machine. Every SQL file is preceded by a PNG Screenshot of the data resulting from the query.

# Visualizations
In the Visualizations folder there are 2 visualization projects, one with PowerBI and one with Tableu.
Because I was unable to Make my PowerBI report publicly accessible, I exported the report as a PDF. 

# Python
